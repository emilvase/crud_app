# Simple CRUD API App Documentation

Welcome to the Simple CRUD API App documentation! This guide aims to provide a detailed explanation of the project structure and the technologies used to build it. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn or an experienced developer seeking a refresher, this documentation is designed to be informative and accessible.

## Overview

The Simple CRUD API App is a project created to demonstrate basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using a RESTful API. It's intended for learning purposes and can serve as a foundation for building more complex applications. The project is written in JavaScript and utilizes several popular libraries and frameworks to achieve its functionality.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to develop the Simple CRUD API App:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.
- **Express Routes**: Express provides a simple and expressive syntax for defining routes and handling HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database program that uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.
- **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a higher level of abstraction for interacting with MongoDB.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure to enhance organization and maintainability:

- **`server.js`**: The entry point of the application where the Express server is initialized.
- **`routes` directory**: Contains route definitions for handling various API endpoints.
- **`controllers` directory**: Houses controller functions that define the logic for handling requests and generating responses.
- **`models` directory**: Contains Mongoose schema definitions for interacting with the MongoDB database.
- **`middlewares` directory**: Contains custom middleware functions used for request processing.
- **`config` directory**: Houses configuration files and environment variables.

## Getting Started

To run the Simple CRUD API App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using npm:
  ```bash
    npm install
  ```
4. Start the server:
  ```bash
    npm start
  ```
5. The server should now be running locally. You can test the API endpoints using a tool like Postman or curl.
